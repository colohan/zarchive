- fix bug that renders line breaks properly in javascript but not django
- create authorized users table, make sure all read/write requests are from
  people we know and like
- create admin interface for adding authorized users
- create search functionality

  scrolling down
- displaying code in monospace font support
- URL linkification
- yellow highlighting of new messages that can be clicked away
- display timezone-aware times
- instance filtering support
- context links that lead to searches

- attach unique monotonic zid to each message (this is only used for identifying
  messages and ordering.  Time handles ordering, do we need the unique ID if we
  can link to a message in some other form?)
- either support graffiti (editing datastore?) or display warning stopping folks
  from posting on graffiti
- ephemeral messages support -- should be easy, just fail to log to datastore

  provide direct links to gchat?  (Is gchat linkable?)
